# working directory
- area where all files, directories and changes are living all the time
- git init is to activate git in the directory
- touch "file name" to create file.

# staging area
- files and directories that we implicitly add to the staging area
(like the croschecking area)
- git add (file) will get the file from the working directory to the 
staging area
- git status is used to know what's been tracked, added, untracked etc on git
- git log will show you the history of your snapshots

# git repository
- where all snapshots are stored.
- git commit -m "message" to move files from the staging area to the repository.
